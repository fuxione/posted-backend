```bash
rails rails db:migrate:reset && bundle exec annotaterb models && bundle exec erd
rails s
```

- how do you make migration more readable? gem for formatting? prettier?
- understand click model more
- how do you organize enums? for models validation?

- add validations
- add seeds
- add buyers_stack resolver (initial -> final [post inclusion/exclusion])
  - create a stack_result ( w? no log_if for all the disabled/excluded buyers)
  - add buyers stats as they are completed (winner, error, timeout)
